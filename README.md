> Hello, my name is Dan! 👋🏼
I am a 21 year old hobbyist developer from Wiltshire, United Kingdom. I am currently working on @Quillshare which aims to offer software solutions to financial based insurance companies. I have been writting code for 4 years on/off and am knowledgeable in python, javascript, typescript, java and kotlin.

When I am not working, or coding I enjoy travelling around Europe and soon to be the United States as well as studying.

If you would like to contact me in regards to a query or proposal, please contact me via <sup>dan@quillshare.com</sup> ♥️
