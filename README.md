> Hello, my name is Dan! 👋🏼

I am a 21 year old hobbyist developer from Wiltshire, United Kingdom. I am currently working on @Quillshare which aims to offer software solutions to financial based insurance companies. I have been writting code for 4 years on/off and am knowledgeable in <sup>python</sup>, <sup>javascript</sup>, <sup>typescript</sup>, <sup>java</sup> and <sup>kotlin</sup>.

When I am not working, or coding I enjoy travelling around Europe and soon to be the United States as well as studying.

If you would like to contact me in regards to a query or proposal, please contact me via dan@quillshare.com ❤️
