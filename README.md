### Hello, my name is Dan! 👋🏼
I am a 21 year old hobbyist developer from Wiltshire, United Kingdom. I am currently working on @Quillshare which aims to offer software solutions to financial based insurance companies. I have been writting code for 4 years on/off and am knowledgeable in python, javascript, typescript, java and kotlin.

When I am not working or coding I enjoy travelling within the United Kingdom, as well as outside of the United Kingdom. I am actively looking to relocate to Canada to work or start my own company.

If you have any queries or proposals for my myself, please contact me via the email below.
